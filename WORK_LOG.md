| 3/5  | 10:55-11:55AM |                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Mr. Blick introduced the problem set and then we started theorizing about data structures we would use. |
| 3/7  |  8:45-9:55AM  |                   We went to the whiteboards and thought about potential ways to lower the threshold of words we have to calculate edit distance for. I came up with an idea to iterate through the Trie and build words, subtracting the differece of the words from the edit distance and terminating if the threshold is reached. |
| 3/11 |  2:00-2:30PM  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I listened to Mr. Blick's presentation on finding the edit distance. |
| 3/11 |  2:30-3:00PM  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I wrote code to set up and initialize a Trie with all of the words in it. I ported my Trie class from SpellCheck. |
| 3/13 | 12:35-1:45PM  |                                                   I wrote a function to find the edit distance based on what we discussed last time in class. I also realized that I had forgotten to commit last time and that I had not committed anything, as I only started writing code in the last class. I apologize for the lack of commits. |
| 3/17 | 10:55-11:55AM |                                                                                                                                                                                              I started writing the code for my Trie DFS function. I got all of my base cases done and am ready to finish the method early next class |
| 3/19 | 9:00-10:00AM  | I finished my Trie DFS function. It worked in a good amount of time, so I converted it into a TST which made the program run even faster. My program passes the test cases in ~30ms. Now I am ready to move on to README and creating a terminal interface. I also realized that I forgot to commit at the end of last class. Sorry! |
| 3/24 | 9:00-10:15AM  |                                                                                           I fixed a bug with early pruning, which I found when I got rid of the tester file and made my own terminal prompt. I made a basic but functional interface to type words and recieve suggestions. I also cleaned up and commented my code. |
