Time Complexity Analysis:

    1. Initializing the data structures: O(N * a),
        where N is the length of the dictionary and a is the average length of the words in the dictionary.
        - It takes O(N) time to iterate through the dictionary file and add each word to the TST.
        - It takes O(a) time to add each word to the TST.

    2. Generating all matching candidates:
    best case: O(m), where m is the length of the input string.
    worst case: O(m * n), where m is the length of the input string and n is the number of nodes in the TST.
        - The DFS method is called on each TST node, which in its worst case will happen for each node in the TST.
        - In its best case, the method will eliminate any branches with too high an edit distance
        - This would lower the number of nodes visited to O(m).

    3. Evaluating Edit Distance: O(m * l), where m is the length of the input string and l is the length of the candidate word.
        - The edit distance is calculated using tabulation, which takes O(m * l) time.
        - This evaluation is done for each call of the DFS method.

    4. Transferring the candidates to an array: O(c), where c is the number of candidates.
        - The candidates are transferred to an array iteratively in O(c) time.

Final Time Complexity:

    Setup: O(N * a)
    N = number of words in the dictionary
    a = average length of the words in the dictionary

    Each Query: O(m^2 * n * l + c)
    m = length of the input string
    n = number of nodes in the TST
    l = length of the candidate word
    c = number of candidates
